# Inventory app

This is a practice project I hope will have some practical use for me personally.
This app is intended to provide a quick way to keep track of items purchased in bulk and used gradually throughout daily life (e.g., food, toilet paper, etc.).
I hope by having this inventory handy, the urge to buy things on sale can be better managed. ;)

## Details
- project is deployed to https://jjmchew.a2hosted.com/inventory
- data is persisted using .yml files
- frameworks:  sinatra / erubis / minitest - relatively light

### Jul 11, 2023
- will create a PostgreSQL db on the backend instead of .yml files
